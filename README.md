#### Why Aksum?
This repo was named after [Aksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum) which is an ancient town in northern [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹. Aksum, also spelt Axum, was the seat of the [Kingdom of Aksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum) aka [Kingdom of Axum](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aksum-ancient-kingdom-Africa) bka [The Aksumite Empire](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-africa/east-africa2/ethiopia/a/the-kingdom-of-aksum) which is modern-day [northern Ethiopia (Tigray province)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigray_Region) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ and Eritrea ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡·. It is well known that The Kingdom of Aksum was known as one of the four greatest powers in the world at the time.

Aksum developed a civilization and empire whose influence, at its height in the 4th and 5th centuries C.E., extended throughout the regions lying south of the Roman Empire, from the fringes of the Sahara in the west, across the Red Sea to the inner Arabian desert in the east.
It holds the fascination of being a "lost" civilization, yet one that was African, Christian, with its own script and coinage, and with an international reputation. It was arguably as advanced as the Western European societies of the time.
